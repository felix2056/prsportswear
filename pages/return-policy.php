                        RETURN POLICY<br>We are able to exchange or provide a store credit if your merchandise is
                        returned and received within 15 days from the date of purchase. <br> <br>Please contact us at
                        contactus@storename.com for a return authorization number and to ensure that it is not a final
                        sale item. You must write this number on the outside of the box in order for your return to be
                        accepted. After 15 days, all sales are final. Unfortunately, we do not provide refunds/credits
                        for shipping/handling charges for returns over 15 days or final sale products.<br>
                        <br>storename.com asks that merchandise is returned in its original condition meaning that the
                        merchandise is unworn, unused, unwashed, and in original packaging and that you include a copy
                        of the invoice or packing slip with your reason for return.<br> <br>Items returned without a
                        return authorization number, past 15 days, or not in original condition will be returned to the
                        customer at the customer's expense.<br> <br>We are not responsible for shrinkage or bleeding as
                        a result of washing your item(s).<br> <br>The following items are not returnable/exchangeable
                        under any circumstances: <br> <br>Shipping charges incurred for exchanges will be billed to the
                        customer who placed the original order unless otherwise specified. Credits to credit cards take
                        approximately two weeks to process from the time the return is received and processed.<br>
                        <br>Canceled or modified orders must be done as soon as possible. Call or email your request, we
                        will do everything we can to assist you. If the order has been shipped we will not be able to
                        cancel or modify the order, it would then be the customer's responsibility to send the package
                        back to storename.com and the original return/ exchange policy will be applied.<br>
                        <br>Exchanged items along with orders that use a store credit are not eligible for free
                        shipping.<br> <br>PLEASE NOTE: All Final Sale merchandise is Final Sale, NO RETURNS, NO
                        EXCHANGES.<br> <br><br>
